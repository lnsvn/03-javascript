## Description

For this project I have modified starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This criteria includes desired password length and character types: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Having a randomly generated password with different character types prevents hackers from accessing your accounts and private information.
